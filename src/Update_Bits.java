/**
 * Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions,
 * i and j. Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N
 * equal to M (e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)

 Example
 Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6

 return N=(10001010100)2

 Note
 In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal,
 you should also return a decimal number.

 Challenge
 Minimum number of operations?

 Clarification
 You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.
 That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.
 You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2,
 because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
